# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Academic Accuracy and Integrity
All content must meet the highest standards of accuracy, ethics, and reproducibility. Primary sources must be used with proper APA citations, maintaining zero plagiarism standards and rigorous fact-checking. Content must ensure clarity for Computer Science students at grade 10-12 level, with complex concepts explained in accessible language.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Content must emphasize interdisciplinary input from Artificial Intelligence, robotics, biomechanics, cognition, and ethics. All contributions should integrate knowledge from multiple fields to provide comprehensive understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics concepts.

### Ethical AI Principles
All content and recommendations must incorporate ethical AI principles of safety, fairness, privacy, transparency, and accountability. Authors must consider the ethical implications of AI and robotics technologies and present them in an educational context.

### Robustness and Safety
Engineering content must emphasize robustness and safety engineering, with appropriate risk assessment and testing methodologies. Safety considerations must be integrated throughout all technical discussions and practical implementations.

### Human-Centered Design
Human-robot interaction content must focus on intuitive, culturally aware design principles. Content should prioritize user experience and human factors in the development and deployment of humanoid robotics systems.

### Technical Excellence
Technical content must follow established standards: simulation-first development, ROS 2 framework usage, Isaac simulation platform considerations, and hardware-software co-design principles. Content should support continuous learning, adaptation, and real-world improvement of systems.

## Technical Constraints
Technology stack requirements include:
- Simulation-first development approach
- ROS 2 framework compliance
- Isaac simulation platform integration
- Hardware-software co-design considerations
- Support for continuous learning and adaptation
- Reproducible experimental results and documentation

## Development Workflow
All content development must follow:
- Iterative development process
- Hypothesis-driven approach to teaching concepts
- Peer-reviewed content validation
- Fully reproducible examples and experiments
- Comprehensive testing of all code examples and simulations

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices and standards within the project. All content must verify compliance with these principles during review processes. Complexity must be justified with clear educational value. Authors should reference this constitution for development guidance.
